<!-- BEM Naming Convention:

BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier. It's a way to structure CSS class names to make them more organized, reusable, and understandable. Here's how it breaks down:

Block: The main, standalone component of your design. In this example, our block is .paragraph-container. This isn't styled directly but is used for structure.
Element: A part of the block that doesn't make sense on its own. Each paragraph is an element within the .paragraph-container block, so they get the class .paragraph.
Modifier: A flag that changes the appearance or behavior of an element. We use modifiers like .paragraph--intro, .paragraph--highlight, and .paragraph--quote to apply specific styles to individual paragraphs.
Key Points:

Hyphens: Hyphens are used to separate block, element, and modifier names.
Double hyphens: Double hyphens are used to indicate a modifier.
Readability: The BEM naming convention makes your CSS code more self-documenting. Just by looking at the class names, you can quickly understand the structure and purpose of the elements.
How It Works:

The basic .paragraph class sets default styles for all paragraphs.
The modifier classes (e.g., .paragraph--highlight) override or add to those default styles to create variations.
The .paragraph-container is a structural block and isn't styled itself, but it helps organize the layout. -->
