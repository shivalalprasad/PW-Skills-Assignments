## Flexbox vs Grid:

**Flexbox** is best for **one-dimensional layouts** (rows or columns). It's ideal for aligning and distributing space among items in a single direction.

**Grid** is best for **two-dimensional layouts**. It's ideal for creating complex layouts with rows and columns, and for positioning items precisely within a container.

**When to use Flexbox:**

* Aligning items in a row or column.
* Distributing space between items.
* Creating responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

**When to use Grid:**

* Creating complex layouts with multiple rows and columns.
* Positioning items precisely within a container.
* Creating layouts with nested grids.
